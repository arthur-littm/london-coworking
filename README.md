## My first day

The Le Wagon coworking is situated at our offices in `138 Kingsland Road, Unit 13, E2 8DY, London`.

The wifi network is `Le Wagon` and the password is `allyouneediscode`.

Is this your first day at the London coworking space ? [Register on Cobot](https://lewagon-london.cobot.me/). At the end of the registration you will be asked for you bank account details for automated payment. This is mandatory and makes it easier for everyone. The billing will be done at the end of the month and payment from your account will be taken at the beginning of the following month. The daily price for the coworking is Â£10 (VAT included), your first day is on us!

Once you've registered and the automatic payment is setup, please send a message to Arthur Littmann (`@arthur-littm` on Slack or arthur@lewagon.com) and send him you MAC wifi address. Here's how you find out what your address is for [macOS](http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/28/find-mac-address-mac-os-x/), [Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/finding-ip-mac-addresses-microsoft-windows-816525) or [Linux](http://www.coffer.com/mac_info/locate-unix.html). Be careful and send the MAC of the wifi card, not the Ethernet card.

If you are a TA in London, please also send your Github username to Arthur.

You now have access to a fiber internet connexion and unlimited coffee!

You can now join the channel `#london-cowork` on the Le Wagon alumni slack, feel free to introduce yourself to other coworkers on that channel.

## Where can I work?

The coworking space is situated to the right when you come into the office, next to the lunch room (there's a big Wagon sticker on the window of the room). The rest of the office is reserved for the students of the Fullstack programme, so please do not use the other rooms while a batch is running.

## Working hours

The coworking is open from monday to friday from 9am to 6:30pm. It's common for the office to stay open until later (events, talks, etc.) which allows you to stay longer, but we can not guarantee that.

It may also happen that Le Wagon requisitions the office space for office improvements, other courses, etc. If it's the case you will be informed of it on Slack on the `london-cowork` channel.

Important : there are two times where you will have to keep the noise down in the common office space  (kitchen, hallways, main room):

9:00am until 10:30am, because of the morning lecture.
5:30pm until 19:00pm, because of the livecode.

During these times please limit your movements in the office and the discussion you may have, the students and teacher will be thankful.

## Coworking Rules

Here are the rules of conduct for the Le Wagon office community, please respect them!

As mentioned in the `Working hours` section, please be quiet inside the office between 9:00am and 10:30am and between 17:30pm and 7pm.
You are of course allowed to get coffee and use the facilities, but please avoid loud discussions in the office space during lectures and livecodes.

The coworking is a `hot desk` only space. That means that every night when you leave your desk should be cleared of all your belongings. There are lockers near the kitchen if you need to leave something in the office overnight.

Please put your dishes in the dishwasher, not the sink.

Please clean up your table after lunch and bring your glasses/mugs to the kitchen at the end of the day, again in the dishwasher, not the sink.

Please keep the noise to a minimum in the coworking to avoid disturbing the other coworkers in the room. For your meetings and phone calls use the lunch room.

## Perks

You can attend all of the Le Wagon evening talks, join Yoga (Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4pm) and other Le Wagon events.
